# About
Cancer is one of the most lethal diseases, and it may also have a significant impact on mental health. 
Palliative care is an important component of cancer care that is provided alongside therapies to delay, halt, or cure the disease. 
Palliative care is intended to alleviate symptoms and enhance your quality of life. 
If there are worrisome symptoms, such as pain or nausea, it can be taken at any stage of the disease.
